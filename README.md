# Size it up!

**Instructions**: 
* Set the base size of page in `rem` using `:root`. 
* In rem, set a font size to each paragraph element with a size for a class. Make the font size represent the size description (small, medium, large etc.).
* Set a font size for the footer. Then, adjust the font-size of the `description` class which should be **relative** to the footer.
